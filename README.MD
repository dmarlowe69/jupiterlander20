This is the classic cartridge game JUPITER LANDER FOR THE VIC 20.
This is a work in progress as I attempt to re-construct the source code. 
I'm using a technique called differential comparison which is very
helpful in this game for the VIC 20 and C64 share code "DNA".

Milestones:

1. identifed the visual elements
2. identifed the tunes played
3. identifed the various graphic screens
4. located code to draw basic elements of the game
5. many more and more to come

note this code was compiled using by version of c_cbm6502asm
